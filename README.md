## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and love learning by **building projects**, experimenting with **front-end and back-end technologies**.  

🧠 I'm curious, self-driven, and always open to **collaborating** on exciting ideas.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing a game of **chess** — it keeps me **sharp, focused, and strategic**, both on and off the board ♟️🧩
